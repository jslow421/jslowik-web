title: John Slowik - Software Engineer | Solutions Architect

## Hey There!

I'm John, a software developer in the SE Wisconsin area. I've earned my AWS Certified Solutions Architect -
Professional certification. Currently, I'm working for Caylent as a cloud native applications software engineer. When I'm not at my computer (which admittedly is rarely) I enjoy watching
movies and tinkering with electronics. I'm a lifelong Minnesota sports fan, so I'm excellent at handling disappointment.
